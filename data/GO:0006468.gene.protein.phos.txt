This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

Gene:6532563938	AT2G17290	AT2G17290.2	protein_coding	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.		 plasma membrane, ATP binding, L mature pollen stage, LP.02 two leaves visible stage, LP.04 four leaves visible stage, LP.06 six leaves visible stage, LP.08 eight leaves visible stage, LP.10 ten leaves visible stage, LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage, M germinated pollen stage, NOT cytosol, abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway, calcium ion binding, calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calmodulin binding, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, carpel, cauline leaf, cell-to-cell mobile RNA, collective leaf structure, cotyledon, cultured plant cell, cytoplasm, cytosol, flower, flower pedicel, flowering stage, guard cell, hypocotyl, inflorescence meristem, intracellular signal transduction, leaf apex, leaf lamina base, mature plant embryo stage, membrane, mesophyll cell, mitochondrion, nucleus, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, petal, petal differentiation and expansion stage, petiole, plant embryo, plant embryo bilateral stage, plant embryo cotyledonary stage, plant embryo globular stage, plasma membrane, pollen, pollen tube cell, protein autophosphorylation, protein binding, protein phosphorylation, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, regulation of anion channel activity, regulation of stomatal movement, regulation of stomatal opening, response to abscisic acid, root, rosette leaf, seed, sepal, shoot apex, shoot system, stamen, vascular leaf, vascular leaf senescent stage	true

Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification.

Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene that is involved in male meiosis cytokinesis. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.		 nucleus, ATP binding, LP.02 two leaves visible stage, LP.04 four leaves visible stage, LP.06 six leaves visible stage, LP.08 eight leaves visible stage, LP.10 ten leaves visible stage, LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage, carpel, cauline leaf, collective leaf structure, cotyledon, cytokinesis by cell plate formation, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, embryo sac cellularization, flower, flower pedicel, flowering stage, guard cell, hypocotyl, inflorescence meristem, kinesin binding, leaf apex, leaf lamina base, male meiosis cytokinesis, mature plant embryo stage, nucleus, petal, petal differentiation and expansion stage, petiole, phragmoplast, plant embryo, plant embryo bilateral stage, plant embryo cotyledonary stage, plant embryo globular stage, plant sperm cell, plasma membrane, pollen, protein binding, protein phosphorylation, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, root, seed, sepal, shoot apex, shoot system, stamen, vascular leaf, vascular leaf senescent stage	false

Gene:2827527	AT2G17290	AT2G17290.1	protein_coding	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366).

Gene:3442500	AT5G55910	AT5G55910.1	protein_coding	Member of AGC VIIIa Kinase family. D6PK is a protein kinase involved that plays a role in polar auxin transport. Most likely acts redundantly with the related proteins: D6PKL1,D6PKL2,and D6PKL3. PIN1 is a target of D6PK phosphorylation. D6PK is associated with sterol enriched membrane rafts and may be involved in regulation of the switch from basal to planar polarity during root hair initiation. Involved in pulse-induced phototropism but also for time-dependent second positive phototropism. Works with PIN3 in the same genetic pathway of hypocotyl phototropism under all light conditions. Involved in the generation of auxin asymmetrical distribution induced by phototropic stimulation.

Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene that is involved in male meiosis cytokinesis. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.

It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Mutants are defective in blue-light response. Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent  activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT1 undergoes blue-light-dependent autophosphorylation. At least eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHOT1. Phosphorylation of serine851 in the activation loop of PHOT1 appears to be required for stomatal opening, chloroplast accumulation, leaf flattening, and phototropism, and phosphorylation of serine849 may also contribute to the regulation of these responses. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the Hinge1 region of PHOT1 appears to require serine350 and serine376.

MPK12 is a nuclear protein and its kinase activity is increased following auxin treatment. MPK12 transcripts are widely expressed in seedlings, but MPK12 expression is stronger in guard cells than in other cell types in mature plants.		 nucleus, ATP binding, LP.02 two leaves visible stage, LP.04 four leaves visible stage, LP.06 six leaves visible stage, LP.08 eight leaves visible stage, LP.10 ten leaves visible stage, LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage, MAP kinase activity, auxin-activated signaling pathway, cauline leaf, cellular response to carbon dioxide, collective leaf structure, cotyledon, cytoplasm, flower, flowering stage, fruit, guard cell, intracellular signal transduction, kinase activity, leaf apex, leaf lamina base, nucleus, petal, petal differentiation and expansion stage, petiole, plasma membrane, pollen, protein autophosphorylation, protein binding, protein tyrosine kinase activity, regulation of gene expression, regulation of stomatal closure, regulation of stomatal movement, response to auxin, response to indolebutyric acid, root, rosette leaf, seedling development stage, sepal, shoot apex, shoot system, signal transduction, stamen, vascular leaf, vascular leaf senescent stage	true

Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.  In Arabidopsis and other organisms, overexpression of ER confers thermotolerance via as yet undefined mechanisms.

Gene:2062267	AT2G34650	AT2G34650.1	protein_coding	Encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that may act as a positive regulator of cellular auxin efflux, as a a binary switch for PIN polarity, and as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

Bacterial avirulence (Avr) effectors AvrB, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 induce a mobility shift in RIN4 and expression of AvrRpt2 induces rapid degradation of RIN4. RIN4 contains 2 sites for AvrRpt2 autocleavage, called RCS1 and RCS2. Overexpression of RIN4 inhibits multiple phenotypes associated with AvrRpt2 function and also inhibits PAMP-induced defense signaling. Attached to the plasma membrane at its carboxyl terminus. Cleaved  by AvrRpt2 at two PxFGxW motifs, one releasing a large portion of RIN4 from the  plasma membrane and both exposing amino-terminal residues that destabilized the carboxyl-terminal cleavage products by targeting them for N-end ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.

Gene:2018253	AT1G04400	AT1G04400.1	protein_coding	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

Mutants are defective in blue-light response. Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent  activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT1 undergoes blue-light-dependent autophosphorylation. At least eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHOT1. Phosphorylation of serine851 in the activation loop of PHOT1 appears to be required for stomatal opening, chloroplast accumulation, leaf flattening, and phototropism, and phosphorylation of serine849 may also contribute to the regulation of these responses. Phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to the Hinge1 region of PHOT1 appears to require serine350 and serine376.

CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK3 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK6 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family.

Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
